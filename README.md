# Calc_char
In this project I came up with the way to encode and decode the  message using the structure of number arrangement in the calculator as the key.

This project is done in c-language.

I did this project in my 1st year of engineering. This is just an idea where a text-character message can be encoded as text-numerical message. 

Furthur details present in "Calc-char.pdf" file.
